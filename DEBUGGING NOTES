DEBUGGING NOTES

** Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined **

	- Make sure to link jquery (such as fullcalendar) before ANY JS files, including control.js 



** Specifying Times **
	- must use ISO 8601 format: file:///Users/maggielou/Downloads/ISO_8601.html






THINGS TO CONSIDER 

	- there exists functionality where you can only select an event of a min time
		- helpful if you want team members to select free time for a meeting, and they can only specify times that are long enough
